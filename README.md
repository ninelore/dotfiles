# ninelore's dotfiles
My dotfiles    
I'm using the following Window Manager:
* i3wm
* qtile (WIP)
* awesome (WIP)

# To-Do
* everything WIP and Subject to change

# Installation
**I recommend using the yay pacman/AUR wrapper.**
The root of the repo resembles $HOME (you need to add the dot to everything in the repo root)

To install all required packages (Arch Linux) run
`yay -Syu --needed $(grep requirements.txt)`
