# ninelore's dotfiles
My dotfiles    
I'm using the following Window Manager:
* awesome
* i3wm
* qtile (tbd, unfinished)

## To-Do

- alacritty: fix vim mouse
- i3: i3status
- awesome: edit/replace/remove mymainmenu
- awesome: edit gaps without restart keybind
- awesome: replace some tray applets with wiboxes
- awesome: rice taglist to be a bit wider

## Installation
**I recommend using the yay pacman/AUR wrapper.**
The root of the repo resembles $HOME (you need to add the dot where it is missing!!)   

To install all required packages (Arch Linux) run this: **requires yay**     
`yay -Syu --needed $(grep requirements.txt)`

NOTE: `cbatticon` is included as autostart in the (i3wm) config. Comment it out for non-battery devices

### Software i use
