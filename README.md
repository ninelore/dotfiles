# ninelore's dotfiles
My Arch/Manjaro i3 and qtile dotfiles (qtile dots WIP)


# To-Do
* dmenubar.sh: List all existing Workspaces and highlight the focused
* dmenubar.sh: get colors from Xrdb
* Xrdb: generate colorsheme from wallpaper (nitrogen)

# Installation
**I recommend using the yay pacman/AUR wrapper. It's also required to use the package list txt coming soon to automaticly install all requirements**

The installation script is WIP!!!!. As of now it only installs dependencys over yay and installs oh-my-zsh

just put the files where they belong, add a dot to the files that belong directly to your home folder and adjust configs where needed
