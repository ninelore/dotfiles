# ninelore's dotfiles
My dotfiles    
I'm using/used the following Window Manager:
* awesome
* i3wm (deprecated: I stopped using i3, so it is unlikely to get improvements from now on)

## To-Do

- awesome: maybe tweak the mainmenu
- vim: lightline colorscheme

## Installation
**I recommend using the yay pacman/AUR wrapper.**
The root of the repo resembles $HOME (you need to add the dot where it is missing!!)   

To install all requirements on Arch Linux run this: **requires yay**   
(`cd dotfiles`)   
`yay -Syu --needed $(cat requirements.txt)`   
`./install-vimplug-ohmyzsh.sh`   

### Recommended software
