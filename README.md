# ninelore's dotfiles
My dotfiles    
I'm using the following Window Manager:
* awesome
* i3wm
* qtile (WIP)

## To-Do

- i3status
- next wm: awesome

## Installation
**I recommend using the yay pacman/AUR wrapper.**
The root of the repo resembles $HOME (you need to add the dot where it is missing!!)   

To install all required packages (Arch Linux) run this: **requires yay**     
`yay -Syu --needed $(grep requirements.txt)`

NOTE: `cbatticon` is included as autostart in the (i3wm) config. Comment it out for non-battery devices

## FAQ
nothing atm
